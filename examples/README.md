# Container Examples and Workflows

Practical demonstrations and code samples for container technologies, covering
development, testing, and production use cases.

## Structure

### ðŸ’» Development Workflows

Real-world development environment setups:

- **[Python Dev Container](development-workflows/python-dev-container/)** -
  Complete Python development environment
- **[Go Microservices](development-workflows/go-microservices/)** -
  Multi-service Go application setup
- **[Multi-language Monorepo](development-workflows/multi-language-monorepo/)** -
  Polyglot project container setup

### ðŸ§ª Testing Strategies

Container-based testing approaches:

- **[Integration Testing](testing-strategies/integration-testing/)** -
  End-to-end testing with containers
- **[Security Scanning](testing-strategies/security-scanning/)** - Container
  security analysis tools
- **[Performance Testing](testing-strategies/performance-testing/)** - Load
  testing containerized applications

### ðŸš€ Production Deployments

Production-ready deployment patterns:

- **[Kubernetes Migration](production-deployments/kubernetes-migration/)** -
  Moving from Docker to Kubernetes
- **[Systemd Services](production-deployments/systemd-services/)** -
  Systemd-managed container services
- **[Edge Computing](production-deployments/edge-computing/)** - Lightweight
  container deployments

## Usage

Each example includes:

- **Setup instructions** - Step-by-step environment setup
- **Configuration files** - Complete working configurations
- **Documentation** - Explanation of concepts and decisions
- **Cleanup scripts** - Environment teardown commands

## Prerequisites

Most examples assume you have:

- Podman or Docker installed
- Basic container knowledge
- Appropriate language runtimes (when needed)

## Running Examples

1. Navigate to the specific example directory
2. Read the README for prerequisites
3. Follow the setup instructions
4. Run the demonstration
5. Use cleanup scripts when finished
