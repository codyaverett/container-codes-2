## Technical Standards

### Command and Code Standards

#### Shell Commands

```bash
# Always include comments for complex commands
podman run -it --rm \
    --security-opt no-new-privileges \
    --cap-drop ALL \
    alpine:latest /bin/sh

# Use explicit flags instead of shortcuts
podman run --interactive --tty  # Good
podman run -it                  # Acceptable for demos
```

#### Code Formatting

- Use syntax highlighting for all code blocks
- Include language specification for syntax highlighting
- Provide complete, executable examples
- Comment non-obvious commands and parameters

#### Version Specifications

- Always specify container image tags (never use `latest` in examples)
- Document tested versions of tools and platforms
- Provide compatibility matrices for major version differences

### Security Standards

#### Principle of Least Privilege

- Default to rootless containers
- Explicitly justify when root privileges are required
- Use `--security-opt no-new-privileges` when appropriate
- Drop unnecessary capabilities

#### Credential Management

- Never show real credentials or API keys
- Use placeholder values clearly marked as examples
- Demonstrate proper secret management practices
- Warn about security implications of demonstrated techniques

#### Vulnerability Awareness

- Mention security implications of demonstrated techniques
- Link to relevant CVE information when applicable
- Provide secure alternatives to deprecated practices
- Regular security reviews of demonstrated code

## Educational Quality Standards

### Learning Objectives

Each episode must have clearly defined, measurable learning objectives:

- **Knowledge:** What facts or concepts will viewers learn?
- **Comprehension:** What will viewers be able to explain?
- **Application:** What will viewers be able to do?
- **Analysis:** What problems will viewers be able to troubleshoot?

### Prerequisite Management

- Clearly state required knowledge at episode beginning
- Link to previous episodes covering prerequisites
- Provide quick refreshers for essential concepts
- Avoid assuming knowledge not previously covered in series

### Practical Application

- Every concept must include practical demonstration
- Provide real-world use cases and scenarios
- Show both success and failure scenarios
- Include troubleshooting for common issues

## Production Quality Standards

### Script Quality

- Comprehensive but not verbose
- Technical accuracy verified against official documentation
- Clear explanations without unnecessary jargon
- Logical flow from basic to advanced concepts

### Demonstration Quality

- All commands tested in clean environment
- Expected outputs documented
- Alternative approaches shown when relevant
- Error scenarios anticipated and addressed

### Supporting Materials

- Complete and accurate reference documentation
