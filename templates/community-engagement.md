# ContainerCodes Community Guidelines üê≥

Welcome to our community of container enthusiasts! To keep our discussions
valuable and welcoming for everyone:

## ‚úÖ Please DO:

- Ask technical questions - no question is too basic!
- Share your real-world container experiences
- Help fellow community members troubleshoot
- Suggest topics for future episodes
- Share relevant resources and tools
- Provide constructive feedback on content

## ‚ùå Please DON'T:

- Post spam or self-promotion without context
- Share personal attacks or inflammatory language
- Post the same question repeatedly
- Share potentially malicious code or commands
- Go off-topic in episode discussions

## üéØ Best Practices:

- **Be specific** - "My container won't start" is harder to help with than
  "Getting OCI runtime error when running podman"
- **Share context** - OS, versions, error messages help everyone learn
- **Search first** - Your question might already be answered in previous
  episodes
- **Format code** - Use backticks for commands and code snippets
- **Be patient** - I read every comment but responses may take time

## üèÜ Community Stars:

Regular contributors who help others consistently may be featured in episodes
and get early access to content!

Remember: We're all here to learn together. Every expert was once a beginner,
and every question helps someone else learn.

Happy containerizing! üöÄ
