# Episode 001 Viewer Questions: Container Internals Deep Dive

## Pre-Episode Anticipated Questions

### Q: Why should I care about container internals? I just want to run my apps.
**A:** Understanding internals helps you:
- **Debug issues faster** - Know where to look when containers misbehave
- **Optimize performance** - Make informed decisions about resource limits
- **Improve security** - Understand attack surfaces and isolation boundaries
- **Choose the right tools** - Pick between Docker, Podman, or other runtimes based on actual needs

Think of it like knowing how your car engine works - you don't need to be a mechanic, but understanding the basics helps you drive better and fix problems.

### Q: Is this Linux-specific? What about Windows/macOS containers?
**A:** The concepts we're exploring (namespaces, cgroups) are Linux kernel features, so yes, this is Linux-specific. However:
- **Windows containers** use similar Windows kernel features (Server Silos, Job Objects)
- **macOS containers** run Linux containers in a VM (Docker Desktop, Podman Machine)
- **Understanding Linux containers** helps you understand all container implementations

We'll focus on Linux because that's where containers originated and where most production containers run.

### Q: Why use Podman instead of Docker for this demonstration?
**A:** Several reasons make Podman better for learning internals:
- **No daemon** - Direct system calls are easier to trace
- **Rootless by default** - Better security model to understand
- **systemd integration** - Shows modern Linux service management
- **OCI compliant** - Follows standards, making knowledge transferable

Don't worry - the concepts apply to Docker too!

### Q: Do I need root privileges to follow along?
**A:** For most demonstrations, **no** - Podman runs rootless by default. However:
- **Namespace inspection** requires root to examine /proc/*/ns/
- **System call tracing** with strace needs sudo
- **Cgroup examination** may need elevated privileges

We'll show both rootless and root examples so you can follow along either way.

## Common Technical Questions

### Q: What's the difference between containers and VMs?
**A:** Great question! Here's the key difference:
- **VMs** virtualize hardware - each VM runs a complete OS kernel
- **Containers** virtualize the OS - they share the host kernel but have isolated userspace

**Performance impact:**
- VMs: Higher overhead (separate kernels, more memory)
- Containers: Near-native performance (shared kernel, minimal overhead)

**Security implications:**
- VMs: Stronger isolation (separate kernels)
- Containers: Shared kernel = larger attack surface, but modern features help

### Q: How secure are containers really?
**A:** Container security depends on several layers:

**Strong isolation:**
- **Namespaces** prevent containers from seeing each other's processes
- **Cgroups** prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **User namespaces** map container root to unprivileged host user

**Potential concerns:**
- **Shared kernel** - kernel vulnerabilities affect all containers
- **Privileged containers** - can break out of isolation
- **Container images** - may contain vulnerable software

**Best practices:**
- Run rootless containers when possible
- Use minimal base images
- Apply security updates regularly
- Use security scanners like Clair or Trivy

### Q: Why do some containers exit immediately?
**A:** This is usually because:
1. **No long-running process** - container needs a process that doesn't exit
2. **Process fails quickly** - application crashes on startup
3. **Wrong command** - specified command doesn't exist or has wrong permissions

**Debugging tips:**
```bash
# See what happened
podman logs <container-name>

# Run interactively to troubleshoot
podman run -it alpine /bin/sh

# Override entrypoint
podman run -it --entrypoint=/bin/sh alpine
```

### Q: What happens to container data when it stops?
**A:** By default, **container data is deleted** when the container is removed. This is by design! Containers should be:
- **Stateless** - don't store important data inside
- **Immutable** - treat containers as disposable
- **Data external** - use volumes for persistent data

**For persistent data:**
```bash
# Named volume
podman run -v mydata:/app/data myapp

# Bind mount
podman run -v /host/path:/container/path myapp
```

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Q: I get "permission denied" errors with containers
**A:** This could be several things:

**SELinux issues (Fedora/RHEL):**
```bash
# Check SELinux status
sestatus

# Fix volume mount permissions
podman run -v /host/path:/container/path:Z myapp
```

**File permissions:**
```bash
# Check file ownership
ls -la /host/path

# Fix ownership (be careful!)
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /host/path
```

**User namespaces:**
```bash
# Check user namespace mapping
podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map
```

### Q: My container can't connect to the internet
**A:** Network troubleshooting steps:

**Check container networking:**
```bash
# Inspect network configuration
podman network ls
podman inspect <container> --format '{{.NetworkSettings}}'

# Test DNS resolution
podman exec <container> nslookup google.com
```

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# Reset networking
podman system reset --force
podman network create mynet

# Use host networking (less secure)
podman run --network=host myapp
```

### Q: Containers are slow on my system
**A:** Performance troubleshooting:

**Check resource limits:**
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
podman stats

# Check for memory/CPU limits
podman inspect <container> | grep -i limit
```

**Common performance killers:**
- **Storage driver** - overlay2 vs fuse-overlayfs performance
- **Logging** - excessive logging can slow containers
- **Resource limits** - too restrictive limits cause throttling

**Optimization tips:**
```bash
# Use faster storage driver
podman info | grep -A5 "graphDriverName"

# Reduce log verbosity
podman run --log-level=warn myapp
```

## Advanced Questions

### Q: Can I run containers inside containers?
**A:** Yes! This is called "Docker-in-Docker" or "Podman-in-Podman":

**Podman approach (recommended):**
```bash
# Mount podman socket
podman run -v /run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock:/run/podman/podman.sock:Z podman/podman

# Or use podman-in-podman
podman run --privileged -v /var/lib/containers:/var/lib/containers podman/podman
```

**Use cases:**
- CI/CD pipelines
- Development environments
- Testing container applications

**Security note:** Nested containers can be risky - the inner container might escape to the host.

### Q: How do I limit container resources precisely?
**A:** Podman supports detailed cgroup controls:

**Memory limits:**
```bash
# Hard memory limit
podman run --memory=512m myapp

# Memory + swap limit
podman run --memory=512m --memory-swap=1g myapp

# OOM kill disable (dangerous!)
podman run --oom-kill-disable myapp
```

**CPU limits:**
```bash
# CPU shares (relative weight)
podman run --cpu-shares=512 myapp

# CPU quota (percentage)
podman run --cpus=1.5 myapp

# CPU set (specific cores)
podman run --cpuset-cpus=0,1 myapp
```

**I/O limits:**
```bash
# Block device read/write limits
podman run --device-read-bps=/dev/sda:1mb myapp
podman run --device-write-bps=/dev/sda:1mb myapp
```
